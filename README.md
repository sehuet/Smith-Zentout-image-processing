# Smith-Zentout-image-processing

This repository gathers the image processing routines used in Smith and Zentout et al. These routines were written in MatLab. They were used to quantify the recruitment kinetics of fluorescently tagged proteins and to measure chromatin relaxation at sites of laser irradiation in livings cells. These codes use two routines that were written by some colleagues :

the routine tiffread was written by Fran√ßois Nedelec, it can be found here : https://github.com/nedelec/tiffread/blob/master/tiffread.m

the routine kmeans_image was written by Jose Vicente Manjon Herrera, it can be found here : https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8379-kmeans-image-segmentation
